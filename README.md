During the pandemic numerous businesses and restaurants were forced to shut down and now, when everything is cooling down we would like to revolutionise
the food industry by changing the system on how restaurants are run using 'SinghBot'.

The code supports following functions, which not only reduces the work-load on the Manager and the Restaurant Staff, but also gives the customers
a range of services at the safety and comfort of their home. Some of these services are as follows :
  1. Placing Orders for Dine-in, Take-away, and online delivery.
  2. Reserving Tables Online.
  3. Order-by-Mood
  4. Valet Assistance
  5. Queries and FAQs
  6. Feedback Collection

And, if just providing services to the customers (without any human-interaction, thus, reducing work force required) was not enough, we also provide the
Management with a set of services, that they can access with special numeric key ('1991478'), which not only will help them in better servicing, but also
make it easy for the administration to see the whole restaurant's logs. Like, some of the admin-exclusive services we provide, are:
  1. Providing Net Expenses and Incomes, based on the orders placed.
  2. Easily-Accessible Database (just 2 keystrokes), that provide them all the neccesary data ranging from customer's information, to customer's feedback,
     from Reservation Plans to the Valet Services Data. (And, we all know, how important data management is, in today's world)
  3. Restaurant's Speciality (Most Ordered Dish).

This database can be further used to enhance the working, servicing and management of the restaurant, in order to give the customers the best-in-class
experience. And, with our Bot, the restaurant would come one step closer to achieve this milestone. And, with future full of Machine Learning and Artificial
Intelligence, our project will make the restaurant the torch-bearers for others, and lead this race of revolution.

And, that's pretty much how our 'SinghBot' will help in managing the services, without much human-assistance, and also increase the profits. And, that's
what a successful businessman wants, more profits with the minimum effort.And, we take this to a completely next level with our 'SinghBot'.
