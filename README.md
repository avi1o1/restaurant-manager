# The Restaurant Manager

The program aims to, not only reduces the work-load on the humanly Manager and the Restaurant Staff, but also provide the customers
a range of services. Some of these services are as follows :
  1. Placing Orders for Dine-in, Take-away, and online delivery.
  2. Reserving Tables Online.
  3. Order-by-Mood
  4. Valet Assistance
  5. Queries and FAQs
  6. Feedback Collection

And, if that wasn't enough, we also provide the a wide range of management services, that the staff can access special access key.
Some of these admin-exclusive services are:
  1. Providing Net Expenses and Incomes, based on the orders placed.
  2. Restaurant's Speciality (Most Ordered Dish).
  3. Easily-Accessible Database (just 2 keystrokes), that provide them all the neccesary data ranging from customer's information, to customer's feedback,
     from Reservation Plans to the Valet Services Data. (And, we all know, how important data management is, in today's world)

This database can be further used to enhance the working, servicing and management of the restaurant, in order to give the customers the best-in-class
experience. And, with our program, the restaurant would come one step closer to achieve this milestone. And, with future full of Artificial
Intelligence, our project will make the restaurant the torch-bearers for others, and lead this race of revolution.

And, that's what a successful businessman wants, more profits with the minimum effort. And, we take this to a completely next level.
